<h2>Project 1: Week 1, September 5</h2>

<p><strong>Story 1: Haribo</strong></p>
<p2>Haribo, a world-renowned confectionery brand, was founded in 1920 by Hans Riegel in Bonn, Germany. The name "Haribo" is an acronym derived from the first two letters of Hans, Riegel, and Bonn. Initially, the company produced a variety of candies, but its breakthrough came in 1922 with the invention of the "Dancing Bear," later known as the "Gummi Bear." These chewy, fruit-flavored gummies quickly gained popularity across Germany and eventually the world. Over the decades, Haribo expanded its product line, introducing other iconic treats like the Goldbears, which remain a staple in candy aisles globally. Haribo's commitment to quality and innovation has made it a beloved brand across generations. Today, Haribo is still family-owned, and its products are sold in over 100 countries, maintaining its position as a leader in the confectionery industry.

<p><strong>Story 2: Fauvism</strong></p>
<p2>Fauvism, an early 20th-century art movement, emerged in France around 1904 and lasted until about 1910. It was characterized by its use of bold, vibrant colors and a departure from traditional representation. The name "Fauvism" comes from the French word "fauves," meaning "wild beasts," a term coined by critic Louis Vauxcelles after seeing the work of artists like Henri Matisse and Andr√© Derain at the 1905 Salon d'Automne in Paris. The Fauvists rejected the subdued palettes and delicate brushwork of Impressionism, instead favoring intense, expressive color applied in broad strokes. Their work emphasized painterly qualities and strong color over realistic values, often distorting forms to convey emotion rather than literal representation. Although the movement was short-lived, it had a profound impact on modern art, paving the way for future avant-garde movements like Expressionism and influencing artists worldwide. Matisse, the most famous Fauve, continued to explore color and form throughout his career.

<p><strong>Story 3: Matryoshka</strong></p>
<p2>Russian nesting dolls, known as Matryoshka dolls, are a traditional Russian folk art form that dates back to the late 19th century. The first Matryoshka was created in 1890 by Vasily Zvyozdochkin, a craftsman in the Abramtsevo estate near Moscow, and painted by artist Sergey Malyutin. Inspired by Japanese nesting dolls, the Russian version took on a distinct character, often featuring a set of wooden dolls decreasing in size, each placed inside the other. The outermost doll typically depicts a woman dressed in traditional Russian attire, while the smaller dolls inside can represent both genders, and occasionally even entire families. Matryoshkas became a symbol of Russian culture and craftsmanship, embodying themes of motherhood, family, and the continuity of life. These dolls gained international popularity after being showcased at the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris, and today, they are cherished as collectibles and souvenirs worldwide.
